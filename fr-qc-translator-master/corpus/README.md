# Corpus

We do not provide the corpus data in plaintext here, but can provide it upon request.

If you would like to generate train, valid, and test sets, you can do so by ensuring that this directory is structured like this (with the files we provide):

```
simpsons/
bible/
querelle/
```

And running this:

`python assemble_corpus.py`
